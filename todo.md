### Project TODOs â€” Hong Kong Travel Planning Web App (AI Agent)

**Current Status**: Demo functional with Poe API integration âœ…
**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Demo Milestone (48h)
- [x] Mock data: POIs/restaurants/hotels, images, opening hours, ratings
- [x] Minimal Plan JSON: required fields only + sample instance
- [x] Frontend: P1 form (budget/dates/places + quick buttons)
- [x] Frontend: Q&A (6 questions, 4-card UI, progress)
- [x] Frontend: Itinerary page with 8 slots (Breakfastâ†’Nightâ†’Accommodation)
- [x] Frontend: Swipe stack per slot (left remove/right keep) + details flip
- [x] Frontend: Overview page (selected options + time windows + static map)
- [x] Backend: Mock endpoints (POST /plans, /answers, GET /plans, /export/pdf, /calendar)
- [x] AI Agent: Poe API integration for travel card generation
- [x] Export: Generate ICS download; PDF returns placeholder URL
- [x] Acceptance: Verify selection persists and overview updates

## Stage 0 â€” Project Setup
- [x] Initialize repo structure and tooling (Node, package manager)
- [x] Select frontend stack (Vanilla JS) and state management (local)
- [x] Bootstrap web app (routing, layout, theming, i18n ZH/EN)
- [ ] Auth scaffolding (OAuth providers config placeholders)
- [x] Backend scaffolding (REST API skeleton, env/config, error handling)
- [ ] N8N environment setup (credentials vault, environments, baseline flows)

## Stage 1 â€” P1 Initial Input
- [x] UI: Budget selector (presets Low/Medium/High)
- [x] UI: Date range picker (no past dates, auto nights)
- [x] UI: Start/End place inputs + quick buttons (Airport, West Kowloon)
- [ ] Places autocomplete (Google Places) and validation
- [x] API: POST /plans (create plan, return plan_id)
- [x] HKO weather integration (9-day forecast)
- [x] Persist `inputs`, `context.weather`, `audit` event

## Stage 2 â€” P2 Expectation Q&A & Itinerary Generation
- [x] UI: Single-question with 4 answer cards, back/next, progress
- [x] API: POST /plans/{id}/answers (persist answers)
- [x] Preference model: basic implementation
- [x] Itinerary skeleton: day/time slots (Breakfastâ†’Nightâ†’Accommodation)
- [x] Mock integrations: POIs, restaurants, hotels with images
- [x] Basic ranking & scoring (popularity, preference_match, weather_fit)
- [x] AI-powered option generation via Poe API
- [x] Persist `itinerary[*].slots[*].options` with images, reviews, transit

## Stage 3 â€” P3 Swipe-Based Finalization
- [x] UI: Tinder-like card stack per slot (left remove/right keep); flip for details
- [x] API: POST /plans/{id}/swipe (record swipe, update selection)
- [x] Auto-refill candidates when depleted
- [ ] Conflict checks: routing continuity, opening-hours feasibility
- [x] AI regeneration on demand
- [x] Persist `swipe_history`, `selected_option_id`

## Stage 4 â€” P4 Overview, Export & Calendar
- [x] UI: Day-by-day overview with selection summary
- [x] API: POST /plans/{id}/finalize (freeze final selection)
- [ ] PDF Export service and template (multilingual, QR/map/booking links)
- [x] API: POST /plans/{id}/export/pdf (placeholder URL)
- [ ] Share: POST /plans/{id}/share (email/social)
- [x] Calendar: POST /plans/{id}/calendar (ICS file download)
- [ ] N8N Flow D: Export pipeline (generate â†’ upload â†’ update links)

## Stage 5 â€” Notifications & Post-Trip Feedback
- [ ] Notification channels (email + web push)
- [ ] Weather/opening-hours change watchers (72h window)
- [ ] Post-trip survey (CSAT, NPS, comments)
- [ ] N8N Flow E: Triggers â†’ reminders â†’ logging

## Stage 6 â€” Data Model & Storage
- [ ] Finalize Plan JSON contract and versioning
- [ ] JSON Schema for validation (Draft 2020-12)
- [ ] Document DB collection, indexing strategy (plan_id, user_id, updated_at)
- [ ] Media CDN policy (images, PDFs), responsive sizes

## Stage 7 â€” Integrations & Abstractions
- [x] HKO API client (9-day forecast) with fallback
- [ ] Google Maps: Places/Photos/Directions wrappers, quotas, keys rotation
- [x] Poe API integration for AI-powered recommendations
- [x] Mock restaurant/hotel providers with realistic data
- [ ] Transit estimation & carbon footprint (optional)

## Stage 8 â€” Security & Compliance
- [ ] OAuth (Google/Apple) + JWT sessions (access/refresh)
- [ ] Secrets management (N8N Credentials, server vault), rotation policy
- [ ] Rate limiting, circuit breakers, input/output validation
- [ ] Privacy: PDPO/GDPR (export/delete data), consent management, attribution
- [ ] CSP, HTTPS-only, CSRF protection, audit logging

## Stage 9 â€” Non-Functional & Observability
- [ ] Performance budgets (P95 < 800ms API excl. third-party; TTI < 3s)
- [ ] Caching strategy (HTTP, CDN, server, client hints)
- [ ] Structured logs, metrics, tracing; dashboards & alerts
- [ ] Front-end RUM (Core Web Vitals), error reporting with sourcemaps
- [ ] Load tests and failover drills

## Stage 10 â€” QA & Acceptance
- [ ] Test plans: unit, integration, contract, e2e (P1â€“P4 funnels)
- [ ] Mock external APIs for repeatable tests
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verification (PDF link < 30s, ICS validity, notifications)
- [ ] Accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Stage 11 â€” Release & Rollout
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines, staging/prod environments, IaC
- [ ] Feature flags for risky features (ranking, push notifications)
- [ ] Rollout plan, monitoring, rollback procedures
- [ ] Post-release analytics review and backlog grooming
